# This represents a compound of gates.  It has an interface similar enough
# to Gate to be used in place of one, though it isn't derived from Gate.
# Ruby thinks this is just fine.

# To build compound circuits, you must create a Blueprint.  To do so:
#   1. Create the Blueprint object.
#   2. Create the objects, and connect them to each other.  Don't make
#      any external connections.
#   3. As needed specify gates you create as input or output devices for
#      the compund.
#   4. Call lock().  This completes the Bluprint and makes it ready to
#      generate compounds.
# The resulting Blueprint is also a Compound.  It can be connected and used
# like a Gate (though it is not derived from Gate).  The another method
# of Blueprint creates a Compound, which can be used in a circuit, but
# lacks the building infrastructure.  The Compound remembers its Blueprint,
# and its another method simply calls the one in Blueprint.
#
# You should not add the same component to multiple compounds.
